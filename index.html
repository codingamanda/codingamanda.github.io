                  The World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that the next pandemic is most likely to be caused by influenza.
                  Moreover, some reports showed that Ebola and Avian Influenza would be the next pandemics.
                  Therefore, we decided to conduct a research on the avian influenza epidemic which has more global influence in order to reduce or prevent the harm.

                      <p>The following visualization shows the animal(including live animal and poultry & egg)
                        exportation and importation relation between the avian influenza affected countries</p>

                      <img src="image/why.JPG" />
                      <p>The reason why we should care about the trade of live animals between countries is because we found 
                        there existed some poultry/eggs trades between Thailand and other countries(such as Japan) in 2004 
                        when the outbreak happened in Thailand and some of these countries became the next outbreak places. 
                        Therefore, we generated more comprehensive graphs to see if the commerce of infected products was 
                        a cause of virus spread.

                      <p>To understand the visualization, please refer the following explanation.
                         First, the middle bar shows the main outbreak countries.
                         The left-hand side shows from which countries that the middle main country imported the live animals products.
                         The right-hand side shows to which countries that the middle main country exported the live animals products.
                         Second, the size of bubble shows the total trade of live animals.
                         Third, the location of dotted lines shows how much trade money of the poultry and eggs products.
