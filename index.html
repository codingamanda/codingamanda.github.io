                  The World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that the next pandemic is most likely to be caused by influenza.
                  Moreover, some reports showed that Ebola and Avian Influenza would be the next pandemics.
                  Therefore, we decided to conduct a research on the avian influenza epidemic which has more global influence in order to reduce or prevent the harm.

                      <p>The following visualization shows <br><br>(1) the animation of yearly avian outbreak countries and <br><br>(2) the animal product(including live animal vs poultry & egg)
                        exportation and importation relation between these affected countries.</p>

                  <div>
                      <img src="image/why.JPG" />
                      <p>The reason why we should care about the trade of live animals between countries is because we found 
                        there existed some poultry/eggs trades between Thailand and other countries(such as Japan) in 2004 
                        when the outbreak happened in Thailand and some of these countries became the next outbreak places. 
                        Therefore, we generated more comprehensive graphs to see if the commerce of potential infected products was 
                        a cause of virus spread.

                        The location of dotted lines shows total trade money of poultry & eggs products.)
